## 🧩 Analysis Board – Business Analyst Workflow in Jira

This screenshot showcases my structured approach to business analysis using Jira (Company-managed project).  
I designed the Analysis Board to reflect the BA lifecycle: from backlog triage to refinement and delivery readiness.

**Highlights:**
- Epic-based backlog organization (color-coded by domain)
- User story decomposition into BA subtasks (e.g. TO-BE process, data model, UI wireframe)
- Clear workflow: TO DO → IN ANALYSIS → READY FOR DEV
- Story refinement example: "Vyhľadanie klienta" with 7 analytical subtasks

This setup mirrors real-world corporate Jira usage in banking, telco, and retail IT environments.


## 🔍 BA Task: AS-IS Process – Client Search

This screenshot documents my analysis of the current (AS-IS) process for client search within the Carpet Deposit Service project.  
It is part of the refinement work for the user story "Vyhľadanie klienta" (Client Search).

**Key insights:**
- Current process relies on Excel forms with no data validation
- Frequent errors due to inconsistent input formats (e.g. casing, field order)
- High duplication rate due to missing unique identifiers
- Pain point: incomplete client data blocks downstream processing

This task is linked to the parent story and forms the basis for TO-BE process design, UI wireframes, and acceptance criteria.
